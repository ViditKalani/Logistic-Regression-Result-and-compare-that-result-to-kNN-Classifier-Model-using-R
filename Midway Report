Abstract:
	In this paper, we analyzed the German Credit Dataset from the Caret Library. By analyzing this dataset, 
were able to create a model that allows us to predict Credit worthiness of a citizen based on a few factors related to credit. 
In order to create this model, we used techniques such as PCA analysis and the KNN recommendation system. We tested our model
by using a training/testing set from the dataset. This form of analysis is integral to the finance industry. Further 
research into these models will benefit credit rating agencies greatly, as they will be able to rate credit worthiness 
quickly and accurately. Ultimately, by using techniques such as the KNN recommendation system, we were able to create a 
model with an estimated accuracy of (TO BE ADDED).

Introduction:
The German Credit Dataset is a dataset that examines a German's credit worthiness and other factors associated with this 
worthiness. This dataset is interesting because it contains a plethora of information regarding credit worthiness. It is 
interesting to see the factors that are needed (and collected) to try to predict credit status. There are many entities that
could benefit from analysis of this dataset. Credit Rating agencies could benefit from this dataset as they are primarily 
interested with evaluating a person's credit. With better prediction models, credit rating agencies could predict credit 
status more accurately and faster. Consumers could also stand to benefit from analysis of this dataset. With a good prediction 
model, a consumer could be able to predict the status of their own credit. Consumers would also learn more about what factors 
contribute to evaluation of credit.  With this project, we plan to obtain more information about credit rating/worthiness 
using outside research. Using our research and dataset, we plan to create a model to predict credit worthiness. This model 
will be able to predict a person's credit worthiness given important attributes of credit worthiness to a decent degree of 
certainty.

	This article describes the importance of credit rating among credit issuers and investors. This paper also describes 
the problems associated with many credit rating models. In order to overcome these problems, a hybrid model was created from 
two existing models.

	This article gives insight into using the kNN classifier. This helps us to learn more about the model we plan to create. 

Using data mining to improve assessment of credit worthiness via credit scoring models:
	This article examines the history and importance of credit scoring models to the financial industry. It also examines 
the role of data mining to improve the assessment of credit worthiness using credit scoring models. Finally, this paper 
compared the accuracy of different credit rating models.  
  
Data Set:
	This dataset is available from the UCI Machine learning website, or in the Caret library through R. This dataset 
contains 1000 samples. This dataset has two values for credit eligibility: good or bad. Predictors of this dataset include 
checking account status, duration, credit history, purpose of the loan, amount of the loan, savings accounts  or bonds, and 
others. Upon initial examination of this dataset, it appears that it is relatively clean. We donâ€™t believe we need to spend 
much time cleaning the dataset. The dataset we used also does not contain missing values. This will be very useful when we 
create a proper model. In order to predict the effectiveness of our data, we plan on splitting our dataset into training and 
testing sets. We have not yet determined the exact split to use. [MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DATASET WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE]
